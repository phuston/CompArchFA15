Following is the provided verilog definition for a decoder:

module decoder1to32
(
output[31:0]    out,
input           enable,
input[4:0]      address
);
    assign out = enable<<address; 
endmodule

This works because it takes the enable input and left shifts it by the 'address'
using the '<<' operator. This effectively moves the enable over address bits, 
setting the output to have the 1 bit in the correct 32 bit location. If enable
is 0, the left-shifted version is still 0, which preserves the functionality 
of the 'enable' input.
